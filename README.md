# Project-Python-OkCards
This application is completely ran through a shell, it uses three important process I thought of that extend mental retention:
- Stochastic process
- Linear process
- Leitner System
Once the user is set, it is possible to create files that will store two decks:
- Deck 1: for main concepts
- Deck 2: for significances

I developed this app mainly to target language learners, however, a dull function can be written to just display the significance without asking the user for an input to guess, this will expand the application and target multiple discipline students, by myself, I utilized flashcards during Electronic, and Industrian Design courses.
